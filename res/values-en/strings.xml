        AR needs to be located according to points with obvious features.\n
        \nTry not to make the camera shot too monotonous (such as: large solid color wall/floor, block the lens resulting in pure black picture);\n
        \nReduce violent shaking; Please use in a well-lit environment.

        Click the Occlusion button to switch occlusion mode, so that AR objects: \n
        \nintegrate into the real environment or ignore the real environment (complete display)

        The first six digits of the MAC address are organizational unique identifiers (OUI). \n
        \nYou can find out the manufacturer of the hidden device by looking at \n

        AR function of this software is developed by AR Foundation of Unity3D, based on ARCore framework of Google.

        We know the location of the device through ARCore\'s motion tracking feature. \n
        \nMotion tracking is based on the Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) technology,\n
        \nwhich analyzes the image and acceleration sensor information to locate the motion.
    </string>
    <string name="tip7">
        Due to the combination of camera and acceleration analysis, AR positioning will fail in several cases: \n
        \n1. Tracking in a moving environment: for example, when a user uses ARCore on a moving elevator, \n
        the data obtained by IMU includes not only the acceleration of the user but also the acceleration of the elevator, which will lead to tracking failure. \n
        \n2. Tracking dynamic environment: For example, when the user takes a picture of the fluctuating water surface, \n
        the image information obtained from the camera is unstable, which will lead to the error of feature point extraction. \n
        \n3. Thermal drift: Both the camera and IMU are temperature sensitive devices, there may be a problem of equipment\n
        heating during the use of the equipment, which will affect the accuracy of the color information obtained by the camera\n
        and the acceleration information measured by the IMU, and then the AR object will drift.

        Update plan:\n
        \n- Bluetooth custom scan and connection;
        \n- Beautify device location information;
        \n- Displays the distance between the selected hidden device and the user in real time.
